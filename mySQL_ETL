/* Performing ETL on a CSV table going into mySQL:

"Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) Provider Summary for the Top 100 Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRG) - FY2011"
https://data.cms.gov/Medicare/Inpatient-Prospective-Payment-System-IPPS-Provider/97k6-zzx3

Resolved Issues:
  (1) stripping "$" in spend amounts
  (2) quotes breaking import; added ENCLODED BY '"'
  (3) turning off/on safe update mode for spend ETL
